								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p>In the vast and ever-expanding realm of online gaming, where camaraderie, strategy, and competition intertwine, one community has risen to prominence - RedFox. Born in 2023 from the inspiration of a dedicated gamer named Pilot2254, RedFox has evolved into a passionate gathering of like-minded individuals, committed to providing the ultimate gaming experience to its members. Let's dive into the captivating story of this gaming community and explore the benefits and opportunities it offers to its loyal members.</p>

                                <h3>The Birth of RedFox</h3>
								<p>RedFox's inception is a testament to the power of gaming passion. Pilot2254, an avid gamer with a penchant for titles like Valorant and CS:GO, aspired to follow in the footsteps of professional gamers like SEN TenZ from Time Sentinels. The name "RedFox" was conceived during an everyday shower, and from that moment, the journey of RedFox began.</p>
								<p>To unite gamers from around the world, Pilot2254 initiated the creation of the TRF Discord server and an accompanying website. This digital domain became the hub for gamers to converge, share experiences, and form lasting connections. Pilot2254 acknowledges the support of his father, who played a pivotal role in securing the RedFox domain name. Armed with the website and server, RedFox started to amass members through diverse channels, including YouTube, social media, and good old-fashioned word-of-mouth.</p>

								<h3>Guide to Full RedFox Membership</h3>

								<h4>1. In-Game Benefits</h4>

								<p>Becoming a RedFox member comes with exciting in-game benefits. To unlock these bonuses, simply change your Riot ID to include "TRF" followed by your name and "#TRF." For example, "TRF Pilot2254#TRF." This modification yields advantages such as increased XP and additional RR points at the conclusion of your game. However, please note that this perk does not include Valorant credits, Radianite points, skins, or account AP.</p>
