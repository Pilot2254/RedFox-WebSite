								<h2>Ranks / Levels</h2>

								<p>There are two different level systems on our server, Ranks and Levels. It's a bit strange at first, but believe me, after reading you will understand the difference and you will find that it's quite simple</p>

								<h3>Levels</h3>

								<p>On our server you can gain levels for example by writing 10 messages, completing an achievement and getting XP for your level. The level feature is on almost every community server, so you might already have some experience with it :D</p>

								<h3>Ranks</h3>

								<p>Ranks on our server are a bit like VIP membership, but much more noble and less frequent. You can gain ranks on our server by winning a giveaway for a rank, by being our partner, by boosting the server, or by purchasing a pack - <a href="../../../pricing/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

								<p>Note: You can get a maximum of 5 ranks on our server (1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50). For each rank you get 1 Million XP</p>

								<h2>Partnerships</h2>

								<br>
								
								<h3>How to become Partner?</h3>

								<p>In the realm of community Discord servers, partnerships stand as integral conduits for expedited growth and enhanced outreach. Recognizing their paramount importance, Team RedFox extends an invitation for collaborative opportunities on our Discord server.</p>

								<p>To initiate the process, kindly join our server <a href="https://discord.gg/QWVzKMfQfz" target="_blank">here</a>, enable the "view all channels" function, then navigate to the dedicated "start-collaboration" channel located in the main category. Here, we encourage you to furnish us with essential details about your server. Include insights such as membership statistics, the nature of your server (communal or specialized), frequency of member activity, the thematic focus of your server, and its primary language.</p>

								<h3>What to do after Partnership is confirmed?</h3>

								<p>Upon successful approval of your partnership request, the owner or administrator of our server will facilitate the seamless integration of our promotional text into your server's advertising channel. It is imperative that this content remains unaltered.</p>

								<p>Furthermore, as a recognized partner, you will be conferred the distinguished "Partner" role. This designation bestows upon you the privilege to periodically share hourly advertisements in the designated "collaboration-servers" channel, housed within the overarching "main" category. Your active participation in this shared space will enhance visibility and engagement, contributing to a mutually beneficial partnership.</p>
