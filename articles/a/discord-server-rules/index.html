            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Toxicity & Roasts:</h2>
            <p>Friendly banter and light roasts are part of the fun, but it's crucial to keep them within reasonable limits. Humor is subjective, so what’s funny to one person may be hurtful to another. Always ensure that your interactions are in good spirit and aren’t crossing into bullying or harassment. We’re here to build a positive community, and bullying of any form will not be tolerated. Anyone found making others uncomfortable or pushing the boundaries will face disciplinary action, which could range from a warning to a ban depending on the severity.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. No Account Boosting or Sharing:</h2>
            <p>Sharing or boosting accounts, whether it’s for gaming or other platforms, is strictly prohibited in this server. This practice not only violates the integrity of competitive environments but also compromises the security of accounts. Users found engaging in account boosting or sharing activities will face swift action, which could include a permanent ban from the server.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. No Private Information Sharing:</h2>
            <p>Privacy is of utmost importance. Never share anyone’s personal or private information—such as full names, addresses, phone numbers, or any other sensitive details—without their explicit permission. Doxxing or any form of personal information leakage is a serious offense and will lead to immediate removal from the server. Always respect others' right to privacy and keep the community a safe and respectful place for everyone.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. Avoid Sensitive Topics:</h2>
            <p>We encourage healthy discussions, but there are certain subjects best left out of public conversations in this server. Discussions about sensitive topics like politics, religion, or anything that could potentially cause division and conflict should be avoided. This is a place to unwind, connect, and have fun, not a platform for debates on controversial issues. Respect each other’s views by avoiding these subjects entirely.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">5. No Advertising or Self-Promotion:</h2>
            <p>While we support your creative endeavors, this is not a space for unsolicited self-promotion or advertising. Please refrain from posting links to your YouTube, Twitch, personal businesses, or any other promotional content without prior permission from the moderators or admins. If you wish to promote something, kindly seek approval before doing so. Spamming or advertising without permission will result in warnings or a potential ban.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">6. No Spamming DMs:</h2>
            <p>Respect other users by not flooding their direct messages with spam. Sending unsolicited DMs, especially in large quantities, is disruptive and can be incredibly annoying. If you need to contact someone, make sure it’s for a legitimate reason, and avoid sending unwanted or repeated messages. Spamming users' DMs will result in disciplinary action, including possible removal from the server.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">7. Respect Moderators and Admins:</h2>
            <p>Moderators and admins are here to maintain order and ensure a great experience for everyone. Please refrain from pinging or messaging them directly unless it’s absolutely necessary. For general support or concerns, use the designated support channels or create a forum post so that issues can be addressed systematically. Disrespecting or attempting to undermine the authority of the moderators and admins will not be tolerated.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">8. Voice Channel Etiquette:</h2>
            <p>Voice channels should be a place where everyone can chat and hang out without disruption. Please avoid using voice changers, making loud noises, or engaging in behavior that disrupts the experience for others. Jumping between voice channels rapidly, screaming, or intentionally causing distractions will result in warnings or temporary voice bans. Let’s keep the voice channels friendly and enjoyable for everyone.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">9. Voice Channel Use:</h2>
            <p>Respect the space in voice channels by not occupying slots unnecessarily or blocking access to others who wish to use the space. If you're in a voice channel and not actively participating, consider moving to a different one or making space for others who may want to join in. Always respect the preferences of others—if someone doesn't want to interact, it's best to find a new group or activity rather than pushing boundaries.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">10. Keep it Legal:</h2>
            <p>It goes without saying, but all server members must adhere to Discord’s Terms of Service, as well as any applicable local or international laws. Any illegal activity—whether it's related to hacking, piracy, or otherwise—will result in an immediate ban and, if necessary, reporting to relevant authorities. We’re committed to creating a safe and law-abiding community.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">11. No NSFW Content:</h2>
            <p>This is a Safe For Work (SFW) server, meaning explicit or inappropriate content is strictly prohibited. Sharing, discussing, or posting NSFW material such as graphic images, explicit videos, or inappropriate jokes is not allowed. Keep the server a comfortable and welcoming place for everyone. Violating this rule will result in immediate action, which could include a temporary or permanent ban depending on the offense.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">12. Username & Avatar Guidelines:</h2>
            <p>Please ensure that your username and avatar are appropriate for all ages. Anything offensive, inappropriate, or designed to impersonate others will result in a request to change your name or avatar. Persistent violations will lead to more severe actions. Let’s keep the community free from inappropriate behavior and maintain a welcoming environment for all.</p>
