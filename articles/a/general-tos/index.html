By accessing or using our Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please refrain from using our Site. Your continued use signifies your acceptance of any changes to these Terms.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By accessing our Site, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. Discord Server</h2>
            <p>As part of our commitment to fostering a vibrant community, we maintain a Discord server where users can interact, share ideas, and collaborate on projects. Participation in this server is a privilege that comes with responsibilities. The rules for participation in our Discord server are outlined in a separate article. By joining our server, you agree to abide by these rules to maintain a respectful and constructive environment. We encourage open communication, creativity, and mutual respect among all members. Violations of the community guidelines may result in temporary or permanent removal from the server.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. Open Source</h2>
            <p>At present, RedFox Studios’ website and projects are not open-source. However, we believe in the principles of collaboration and transparency, and this status may change in the future. We are exploring the possibility of making our projects available on platforms like GitHub under open-source licenses, including the Apache V2 license. Should this happen, we will notify our users and provide access to the relevant resources. For now, we appreciate your understanding and encourage feedback on how we can best serve the community and consider open-source opportunities.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. Code Protection and Restrictions</h2>
            <p>To safeguard our intellectual property, our website is equipped with a script designed to restrict copying or interacting with the development tools. While we implement these protective measures to prevent unauthorized access, we recognize that such protections may not be foolproof. Therefore, we kindly request that you do not attempt to copy, replicate, or otherwise misuse any part of our website or projects without explicit permission from RedFox Studios. Unauthorized copying or distribution of our code, designs, or any other intellectual property is strictly prohibited and may lead to legal action. We take these matters seriously to protect our hard work and the integrity of our community.</p>

            <p>Please note that these Terms serve as general guidelines applicable to all users of our Site. If you are a client engaging with RedFox Studios for specific services or collaborations, separate Terms of Service will apply. We recommend reviewing those Terms to understand your rights and obligations in relation to our services. These client-specific Terms will provide detailed provisions covering aspects such as project deliverables, payment terms, and confidentiality. If you have any questions regarding these separate Terms, please do not hesitate to reach out for clarification.</p>

We encourage you to review these Terms periodically to stay informed of any updates. Your engagement and compliance are vital to creating a positive and secure environment for all users.</p>
