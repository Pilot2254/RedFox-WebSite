            <p>When you first join our Discord servers, things might seem a little overwhelming, especially if you're new to Discord or just don’t use it often. Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered! Let us guide you through the process, starting with onboarding and explaining the differences between RedFox Studios (RFS) and Team RedFox (TRF).</p>
            <p>When you join our servers, the first step is to complete the onboarding process. This ensures you get the right roles and access to the channels that suit your interests. During onboarding, you'll have the chance to choose specific roles that best describe you, ensuring you’re placed in the right communities. After that, you’ll need to accept the server rules. Only then will you be able to interact and view the server's full content.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Difference between RedFox Studios and Team RedFox</h2>
            <p><strong class="font-bold">RedFox Studios (RFS)</strong>: This server is focused on all things development—whether it's programming, game design, 3D modeling, or any other creative pursuit. You'll also find announcements and updates about ongoing projects, events, and news from the world of development.</p>
            <p><strong class="font-bold">Team RedFox (TRF)</strong>: This server is primarily a gaming community and esports team hub. Here, you'll find discussions around competitive gaming, favorite games, and esports events. Whether you're a casual player or an esports enthusiast, this is the place for you!</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Onboarding at RedFox Studios (RFS)</h2>
            <p>Onboarding at RFS is simple and helps to tailor your experience to your interests:</p>

                <li><strong class="font-bold">Select Your Interests</strong>: Are you a programmer, designer, or 3D modeler? Choose what you are passionate about so we can connect you to the right channels and community.</li>

                <li><strong class="font-bold">Select Notifications</strong>: Like RFS, choose what kind of updates you want to receive. You’ll be able to stay on top of important announcements or esports-related news.</li>
