            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to RedFox Studios! These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern the relationship between you (“Client”) and RedFox Studios (“Company”), a business founded and run by hobbyist Michal Flaška. By engaging our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use our services.</p>
        
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Services Provided</h2>
            <p>RedFox Studios specializes in basic services focused on design and front-end web development. Our offerings may include, but are not limited to, website design, user interface (UI) design, and front-end implementation. It is important to note that we do not provide back-end development or server management services. Clients seeking these services will need to engage with other providers who specialize in those areas.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. Client Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>As a Client, you agree to provide all necessary information, materials, and access to resources that may be required for the successful completion of the project. Timely communication and collaboration are essential for achieving the desired results. You are responsible for ensuring that all materials provided to RedFox Studios comply with applicable laws and do not infringe upon any third-party rights.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. Payment Terms</h2>
            <p>Upon agreement to proceed with a project, a payment schedule will be established based on the scope and complexity of the services requested. Invoices will be issued at designated milestones, and payment is expected within the specified timeframe. Late payments may incur additional fees, and RedFox Studios reserves the right to suspend work until payment is received.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. Project Timeline</h2>
            <p>RedFox Studios will make every effort to adhere to the agreed-upon project timeline. However, delays may occur due to unforeseen circumstances, client-related delays, or changes in project scope. In such cases, we will communicate any adjustments to the timeline promptly and work collaboratively to minimize any disruptions.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">5. Revisions and Changes</h2>
            <p>Clients are entitled to a specified number of revisions as outlined in the project agreement. Any additional revisions beyond the agreed-upon scope may incur extra charges. We encourage open communication throughout the project to ensure that the final product meets your expectations.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">6. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
            <p>Upon full payment for the services rendered, the Client will retain ownership of the final deliverables. RedFox Studios retains the right to showcase the completed projects in our portfolio and marketing materials unless otherwise agreed upon in writing. All underlying code, designs, and proprietary tools used during the development process remain the intellectual property of RedFox Studios.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">7. Termination of Services</h2>
            <p>Either party may terminate the services with written notice if the other party breaches any material term of these Terms and fails to remedy such breach within a reasonable timeframe. In the event of termination, the Client will be responsible for payment for all services rendered up to the date of termination.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">8. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>RedFox Studios reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms. Your continued engagement with our services after any modifications indicates your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
