                <p class="mb-4">I'm pilot2254, you can call me Mike. I'm from Slovakia and I like to play games and program. Maybe you are asking why the fuck I created this book? Well, I don't know the answer either. I just woke up one day, hit my head on the shelf and got the idea to create a book and describe my strange life in it. I'll describe in this book why the hell I still haven't found a girlfriend, why I leave my friends and they leave me and so on and so on...</p>
                <p class="mb-4">It can be said that what you are reading here and what you are looking at cannot even be called a book, I would rather call it '<span class="italic">My next article with a bad design</span>'... I also have the feeling that I created this "<span class="italic">article</span>" for myself and for others to learn from my mistakes and never repeat them again in their lives, because my mistakes are not worth repeating.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">In this book I am going to explain my life even in small details, because everything builds on each other and if I were to write only important things here you might not understand them, because it will contain a little more characters from my life which are necessary for this article.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">But don't worry, I'll add a list of characters below this page so you can understand who's who and you can come back here anytime. Sometimes I will also include how i call them...</p>

                <p class="mb-4">This chapter will be a bit weirder, but I believe you have a brain at least a bit bigger than a billiard ball and your IQ is higher than the number on the ball... Nah, I'm just kidding.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">It was a typical evening, <a href="#characters" class="nav-link text-red-500 hover:underline">Viliam</a> and I were lounging around looking for some entertainment. What did we choose? A chaotic, evil and gay online game called VALORANT. This time, however, we decided to spice it up by diving into the London servers, where the competition was completely different because I learned that we were playing against braindamaged people there (nothing against london servers and people in it). It was our little secret - playing there almost felt like we had an unfair advantage. As we dove into the next round, we came across someone who would soon become a memorable part of our gaming escapades: Brina. Her presence injected a dose of humor into our Discord conversations and elevated the entire gaming experience. It wasn't just about the wins, but also the laughter and camaraderie that resulted. For three wonderful months, Brina became an integral part of our virtual team. Her jokes, quirks, unmistakable presence - we savored every moment. It was as if we had stumbled upon a kindred gamer soul, someone who just got us. But then, as if someone decided to throw the ball, Brina disappeared. She was probably very happy to press the dreaded "block" button, and she disappeared from our sight without a trace. It hit us like a bolt from the blue. What happened? What did we do to deserve this sudden departure?</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Days turned into weeks and unanswered questions lingered like a stubborn itch. We racked our brains, replaying every conversation on Discord, every joke in the game, looking for clues. But the more we searched, the clearer the answers became, she made it naschval. You see, there was one game - a coveted title that Brina had been eyeing for a while. We were considering giving it to her as a gesture of camaraderie and friendship. But fate intervened and we never did. Looking back on it, I can't help but be grateful for this twist of fate. It was a reminder that sometimes the best of intentions can lead to unforeseen consequences. Perhaps it was a blessing in disguise that spared us further heartache and turmoil. They say that everything bad is good for something, I have come to understand that after a few years and now I don't worry so much about a lot of things anymore. Of course, we would like to find out one day what happened that made Brina give up on us...</p>
