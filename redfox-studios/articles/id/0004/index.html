                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">RANKS / LEVELS</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">There are two different level systems on our server, Ranks and Levels. It's a bit strange at first, but believe me, after reading you will understand the difference and you will find that it's quite simple</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">RANKS</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">On our server you can gain ranks for example by writing 10 messages, completing an achievement and getting XP for your rank. The rank feature is on almost every community server, so you might already have some experience with it :D</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">LEVELS</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">Levels on our server are a bit like VIP membership, but much more noble and less frequent. You can gain levels on our server by winning a giveaway for a level, by being our partner, by boosting the server several times, or by purchasing a pack <a href="https://www.patreon.com/Pilot2254" target="_blank" class="text-red-500 hover:underline">Here</a>.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Note: You can get a maximum of 7 ranks on our server (E, D, C, B, A, S and S+). For each rank you get 1 Million XP and some benefits.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">PARTNERSHIPS</h2>
                <br>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">HOW TO BECOME PARTNER?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">In the realm of community Discord servers, partnerships stand as integral conduits for expedited growth and enhanced outreach. Recognizing their paramount importance, Team RedFox extends an invitation for collaborative opportunities on our Discord server.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">WHAT TO DO AFTER PARTNERSHIP IS CONFIRMED?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">Upon successful approval of your partnership request, the owner or administrator of our server will facilitate the seamless integration of our promotional text into your server's advertising channel. It is imperative that this content remains unaltered.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Furthermore, as a recognized partner, you will be conferred the distinguished "Partner" role. This designation bestows upon you the privilege to periodically share hourly advertisements in the designated "collaboration-servers" channel, housed within the overarching "main" category. Your active participation in this shared space will enhance visibility and engagement, contributing to a mutually beneficial partnership.</p>
